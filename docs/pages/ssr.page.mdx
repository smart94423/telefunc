Telefunc has first-class support for SSR (Server-Side Rendering).

Dependening on your deploy target,
there are several SSR strategies:

If we don't use `getContext()` then we don't need and just works as we expect.

But we if we use `getContext()` then we need to use a mechanism to provide the context.

Strategy | Mutation-only | No Context | Production Node.js Server | Edge Computing
-|-|-
No Context | X | X
Mutation-only | X | X
Async Hooks | X | X
Telefunc Component | X | X

- Node.js production server => Async Hooks
- Edge Computing (Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, ...) => Telefunc Component

## Strategy: Async Hooks

## Strategy: Mutation-only

The easiest way to use SSR.
