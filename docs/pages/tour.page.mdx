Reading recommendation:
 - For seniors already familiar with RPC: only [Inversion of Control](#inversion-of-control) and [TypeScript](#typescript)
 - For anyone else: everything.

## Hello World

```js
// hello.telefunc.js
// Environment: Node.js server

export { hello }

async function hello(name) {
  return 'Welcome ' + name
}
```

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="view">Loading...</div>
    <script type="module">
      import { hello } from './hello.telefunc.js'
      const message = await hello('Eva')
      console.log(message) // Prints Eva
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## How it works

> It's **important to have a clear understanding of how Telefunc works**;
> it will ensure that we properly secure our Telefunctions with `shield()` and `Abort()` and induces increased productivity.

## ORM/SQL instead of REST/GraphQL

## Telefunctions are cheap

## Inversion of control

In a classical REST/GraphQL, it is the backend who determines & controls the structure of the API.

With the Telefunc it's the other way around: it is the frontend who determines & controls telefunctions.

## TypeScript

We highly recommend to use Telefunc with TypeScript.
