When writing isomorphic code, we have to be careful to execute code in the right environment.

> **What is isomorphic code?** Code is called _isomorphic_ when it is loaded on our Node.js server as well as in the user's browser, which is frequent when using full-stack frameworks such as Vike or Next.js.

```js
// Environment: Node.js, browser

import { onTelefunctionRemoteCallError } from 'telefunc/client'

// This works when the environment is the browser but throws an
// error when the environment is Node.js.
onTelefunctionRemoteCallError(() => {
  /* ... */
})
```

```
Error: [telefunc][Wrong Usage] Using `onTelefunctionRemoteCallError()` (`import { onTelefunctionRemoteCallError } from 'telefunc/client'`) is forbidden on the server-side, see https://telefunc.com/isomorphic-import
```

To fix this, we ensure that our client-side code is not called on the server-side:

```js
import { onTelefunctionRemoteCallError } from 'telefunc/client'

const isBrowser = typeof window !== 'undefined'
if (isBrowser) {
  onTelefunctionRemoteCallError(() => {
    /* ... */
  })
}
```
