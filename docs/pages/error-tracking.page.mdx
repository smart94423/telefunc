To track errors, we use `onBug()`:

```js
import { onBug } from 'telefunc'

onBug(err => {
  // ...
})
```

Allowing us, for example, to install the tracker code of a tracking service ([Sentry](https://sentry.io/), [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/), [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/), ...).

`onBug()` is called:
 - When Telefunc throws an error (Telefunc has a bug).
 - When one of your telefunction throws an error (your telefunction has a bug).

> Note that `throw Abort()` won't trigger `onBug()`: it is expected that a third-party may make a wrongful call that leads to a `throw Abort()`. In other words: `throw Abort()` is expected and isn't a bug.
