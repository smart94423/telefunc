With REST/GraphQL, API endpoints are:
 - Generic
 - Backend-owned

With Telefunc, it's the exact opposite as telefunctions are:
 - Tailored
 - Frontend-owned

This inversion leads to profound improvements in development speed.

That's why we recommend to implement what we call *event-based telefunctions*.

> You may be tempted to create generic telefunctions but this is an anti-pattern as explained below.


## Example

Let's imagine a to-do app that wants to implement a new feature "mark all tasks as completed".

With a RESTful API, the app does these requests:

```
HTTP VERB       HTTP URL                                      HTTP BODY PAYLOAD
=========       =========================================     =====================
GET             https://api.todo.com/task?completed=false     ∅
POST            https://api.todo.com/task/42                  { "completed": true }
POST            https://api.todo.com/task/1337                { "completed": true }
POST            https://api.todo.com/task/7                   { "completed": true }
```

> It's usually the backend team that owns and is responsible of implementing and modelling such API.

With Telefunc, the app calls a telefunction like this instead:

```ts
// TodoList.telefunc.ts
// Environment: Server

export async function onMarkAllAsCompleted() {
  // With SQL
  await sql('UPDATE tasks SET completed = true WHERE completed = false')

  // With an ORM
  const updateUser = await Tasks.update({
    where: {
      completed: false
    },
    data: {
      completed: true
    },
  })
}
```

> With Telefunc, it's the frontend team that owns and is responsible for defining telefunctions.

The key difference is that our telefunction `onMarkAllAsCompleted()` is created specifically to serve the needs of the component `TodoList.tsx`, whereas the RESTful API is a set of generic endpoints that are agnositc to the frontend.

> This key difference is the foundation of why Telefunc enables unparalleled development speed.

In our example, we named our telefunction `"onMarkAllAsCompleted"` because it's triggered by a user event:

```tsx
// TodoList.tsx
// Environment: Browser

import { onMarkAllAsCompleted } from './TodoList.telefunc.ts'

function TodoList() {
  return <>
    <button onClick={ async () => await onMarkAllAsCompleted() }>
      Mark all as completed
    </button>
    {/* ... */}
  </>
}
```

While defining telefunctions tailored to serve the needs of a UI commponent, we soon realize that telefunctions are always triggered by some kind of event.

That's why we recommend to start all telefunction names with `"on"`:


## Naming convention

We recommend to prefix all telefunction names with `"on"`:

```bash
    TELEFUNCTION NAME
    =================
❌  updateText
✅  onTextUpdate
❌  loadData
✅  onLoad
✅  onPagination
✅  onInfiniteScroll
```

We also recommend to collocate `.telefunc.js` files with UI components:

```bash
    FILES
    ===============================
    components/TodoItem.tsx
✅  components/TodoItem.telefunc.ts
❌  db/todo.telefunc.ts
    pages/edit/Page.vue
✅  pages/edit/Page.telefunc.js
❌  pages/edit/all.telefunc.js
```

To foster event-based telefunctions, Telefunc displays a warning whenever a convention isn't followed:

<CodeBlock lineBreak={true}>{'[telefunc][Warning] We recommend the name of your telefunction textChange() (/componens/TodoItem.ts) to start with "on", see https://telefunc.com/event-based#naming-convention'}</CodeBlock>
<CodeBlock lineBreak={true}>{'[telefunc][Warning] We recommend to collocate your telefunc file /db/todo.telefunc.ts next to a component file, see https://telefunc.com/event-based#naming-convention'}</CodeBlock>

> First-time Telefunc users often create generic telefunctions because that's what we are used to do with REST/GraphQL, but defining tailored telefunctions instead is paramount to reap the full benefits of Telefunc.

> If you want to deviate from the naming convention, then reach out on GitHub or Discord: if there is a valid use case for not respecting the naming convention, then Telefunc will implement an option to disable it.
