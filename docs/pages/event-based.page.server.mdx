With REST/GraphQL, API endpoints are:
 - Generic
 - Backend-owned

With Telefunc, it's the exact opposite as telefunctions are:
 - Tailored
 - Frontend-owned

This inversion leads to profound improvements in development speed.

That's why we recommend to implement what we call *event-based telefunctions*.

> You may be tempted to create generic telefunctions but this is an anti-pattern as explained below.


## Example

Let's imagine a to-do app that wants to implement a new feature "mark all tasks as completed".

With a RESTful API, the app does these requests:

```
HTTP VERB       HTTP URL                                      HTTP BODY PAYLOAD
=========       =========================================     =====================
GET             https://api.todo.com/task?completed=false     ∅
POST            https://api.todo.com/task/42                  { "completed": true }
POST            https://api.todo.com/task/1337                { "completed": true }
POST            https://api.todo.com/task/7                   { "completed": true }
```

> It's usually the backend team that owns and is responsible of implementing and modelling such API.

With Telefunc, the app calls a telefunction like this instead:

```ts
// TodoList.telefunc.ts
// Environment: Server

export async function onMarkAllAsCompleted() {
  // With SQL
  await sql('UPDATE tasks SET completed = true WHERE completed = false')

  // With an ORM
  const updateUser = await Tasks.update({
    where: {
      completed: false
    },
    data: {
      completed: true
    },
  })
}
```

> With Telefunc, it's the frontend team that owns and is responsible for defining telefunctions.

The key difference is that our telefunction `onMarkAllAsCompleted()` is created specifically to serve the needs of the component `TodoList.tsx`, whereas the RESTful API is a set of generic endpoints that are agnositc to the frontend.

> This key difference enables a much faster development speed. That's why we recommend to implement telefunctions that are tailored instead of generic. There are exception to this recommendation which we elaborate below.

In our example, we named our telefunction `"onMarkAllAsCompleted"` because it's triggered by a user event:

```tsx
// TodoList.tsx
// Environment: Browser

import { onMarkAllAsCompleted } from './TodoList.telefunc.ts'

function TodoList() {
  return <>
    <button onClick={ async () => await onMarkAllAsCompleted() }>
      Mark all as completed
    </button>
    {/* ... */}
  </>
}
```

While defining telefunctions tailored to serve the needs of a UI commponent, we soon realize that telefunctions are always triggered by some kind of event.

That's why we recommend to start all telefunction names with `"on"`:


## Naming convention

By default, we recommend to prefix all telefunction names with `"on"`:

```bash
    TELEFUNCTION NAME
    =================
    # Generic telefunction
❌  updateTodoItem
    # Tailored telefunction reacting to a specific user event
✅  onTodoItemTextUpdate
    # Tailored telefunction reacting to a specific user event
✅  onTodoItemCompleteToggle

    # Data-fetching telefunction
❌  loadData
✅  onLoad
✅  onPagination
✅  onInfiniteScroll
```

We also recommend to collocate `.telefunc.js` files with UI components:

```bash
    FILES
    ===============================
    # UI Component
    components/TodoItem.tsx
✅  components/TodoItem.telefunc.ts
❌  db/todo.telefunc.ts

    # UI Component
    pages/edit/Page.vue
✅  pages/edit/Page.telefunc.js
❌  pages/edit/all.telefunc.js
```

To foster event-based telefunctions, Telefunc displays a warning whenever the naming convention isn't followed.

> First-time Telefunc users often create generic telefunctions out of the habit of using REST/GraphQL, but defining tailored telefunctions instead is usually the better appraoch as explained above.

We can use `disableNamingConvention` to disable the warnings:

```js
// server.js

import { telefuncConfig } from 'telefunc'
telefunc.disableNamingConvention = true
```

## Exceptions

We recommend implementing telefunctions that are tailored instead of generic, as explained above.

But there are exceptions.

The most common one is if our telefunctions are cosumed not only by one client but by several clients and if these clients are deployed independently of each other. In that case it can make sense to define few generic telefunctions covering all clients at once instead of defining different telefunctions for each client (it then also make sense to not respect the naming convention).

> An alternative is to deploy one Telefunc server per client; that way we preserve the fast development speed of tailored telefunctions.
