Your frontend can use telefunctions in order to directly use SQL/ORM queries.

```js
// movies.telefunc.js
// Environment: Node.js server

import sql from 'some-sql-client'

export { getStarWarsMovies }

// We define a new telefunction `getStarWarsMovies()` that essentially wraps a SQL query.
// Telefunctions are always exectued in Node.js â€” we can use any SQL/ORM query we want.
async function getStarWarsMovies(text) {
  const movies = await sql.query('SELECT id, text, year FROM movies WHERE franchise = "Star Wars";')

  /* Or if we use an ORM:
  const movies = Movies.findAll({
    where: {
      franchise: 'Star Wars',
    },
    select: ['id', 'text', 'year']
  )}
  */

  return movies
}
```

```js
// Environment: Browser

// `movies.telefunc.js` is not actually imported: the Telefunc transformer transpiles all
// `*.telefunc.js` imports into a thin library that makes HTTP requests. More infos at "How It Works".
import { getStarWarsMovies } from './movies.telefunc'

// We call our telefunction `getStarWarsMovies()`, remotely from the browser
const movies = await getStarWarsMovies()
// Print the movies in the browser's dev console
console.log(movies)
```

Creating new telefunctions is cheap; instead of trying to create generic telefunctions and re-use them, we simply create a new telefunction for each frontend need.

In other words, instead of thinking in terms of generic enpdoints, the frontend simply direclty use any SQL/ORM query it needs to do its job.

This essentially means that we remove the API layer abstraction.

> Historically, an API layer was needed because frontend and backend were deployed independently of each other.
>
> The increasingly ubiquitous practice of deploying frontend and backend hand-in-hand makes the API layer obsolete.
>
> For example, if you use Next.js, then you always deploy your React frontend and your backend code hand-in-hand.
> When frontend and backend are deployed at the same time, Telefunc (and RPC in general) is a simple and powerful solution.
