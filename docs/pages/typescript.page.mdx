                <code>shield()</code> infers types so you define your times only once for both runtime and compile-time.

                From TypeScript's perspective, the frontend directly imports server functions (TypeScript doens't know
                that the
                <code>.telefunc.js</code> files are transformed). In other words: TypeScript just works.
